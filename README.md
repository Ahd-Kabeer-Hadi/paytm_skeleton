# Paytm Skeleton

Paytm Skeleton is a beginner-level project aimed at practicing database transactions using MongoDB. The project utilises React with TypeScript for the front end and Node.js for the back end. It serves as a refresher project, helping developers revisit core concepts and improve their skills.

## Features

-   **MongoDB Integration**: Implements transactions in MongoDB, providing hands-on experience with database operations.
    
-   **React with TypeScript**: Utilises modern front-end technologies, including React and TypeScript, for building a dynamic user interface.
    
-   **Node.js Backend**: Employs Node.js for the server-side logic, facilitating data processing and interaction with the database.


## Purpose

As I revisit some of the core concepts, Paytm Skeleton serves as my playground to deepen my understanding of database transactions, especially with MongoDB. By immersing myself in both front-end and back-end development, I aim to strengthen my skills and gain a comprehensive understanding of building web applications. This project allows me to experiment, learn, and grow as a developer while refreshing my knowledge of fundamental concepts.
